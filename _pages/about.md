Student at Future Reality Lab working with Prof. Ken Perlin

Full stack game developer. I do indie games as a hobby in my free time. Check out some of my [unpublished and soon-to-be-published projects](projects/#Games/)!!

I have also gained a lot of experience developing AR/VR/XR platforms under Future Reality Lab, on development skills and team collaboration. Most of our projects are using Unity's XRKit and webXR. Give [these projects](projects/#VR/AR/XR) a look!

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, playing guitar, walking around the city, jogging at the Central Park. I also love to go to the mountains! On summer it's hiking and on winter it's snowboarding.

Strength: Unity game development with C#, Unreal Engine 4/5 game development with C++ (UE's API) and Blueprint, Javascript, webXR.

Other things I can do: writing shaders; network engineering with npm; machine-learning model fine tuning and integrating; 3D modeling using Blender, 3DSMax, Maya, ...
