All games mentioned below are written in Unity.

In summer 2020, I wanted to do something during the lockdown, so I decided to do some small games and post them on some random game jams. Here are the collection of games I have done.

The [Meteor](https://vincenthu0326.itch.io/meteor) game was made by me in only 48 hours. I remember the theme for the jam was "something is missing" or something, so I think - how about missing pieces of a spacecraft? The most difficult part for me was to write the movement of the space car in such a short time, well, I managed to finish it, but I didn't have time to test the difficulty curve - so this game is very hard, at least from my perspective.

The [Abyss](https://vincenthu0326.itch.io/abyss) game was less technically difficult, but it got more response, I consider those positive feedbacks were due to the atmosphere of this game. I made it based on my definition of thalassophobia, and the only thing worth mentioning is the post process to make the underwater feeling.

During that time, I had also made a game that wasn't on any jam, but I think it's worth mentioning it. It came from the idea of a rogue cyborg running away from the police on the rooftops of a cyberpunk-themed city. Other than the 3D model for the protagonist, I have made nearly every single piece of asset of this game, from the 3D models of the environment and weapons, to the Third Person Shooter mechanics and animation tree, the save/load system, as well as the enemy AI, including cyborg polices and drones. It was definitely an exhausting experience, and the output quality isn't enough to be published at the game store. Still, it's a valuable experience to give me a general sense of the process of game development.
